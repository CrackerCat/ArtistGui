If not otherwise stated the only changes made, where the renaming of the top-level packagename
from `com` to `com2`, in order to be able to deploy it on android devices within in application APK.

The exception is the class `com2.android.dx.merge.DexMerger` in file:
 `src/main/java/com2/android/dx/merge/DexMerger.java`

## DexMerger Changes

Added functions, to merge 2 dex-files with merging their ClassDefs.

- `private void mergeMainDexClassDefs()`
- `public Dex mergeMethodsOnly() throws IOException
- `private Dex mergeDexesMethods() throws IOException
- `private boolean isCodeLibDexFile(Dex dex)`
- `private SortableType[] getMainDexSortedTypes()`\
   => Skips the last dexfile in the row, which is the codelib dexfile
